With this EP, Gladkill expresses that there are few actual accolades earned through independently creating and sharing art in this fast-paced digital society and over-saturated musical market. An artist must create his or her own rewards, with every release, song, and project becoming an accolade in itself; a milestone of one's catharsis, progression and accomplishment. While staying true to his melodic and musical roots, Gladkill seamlessly traverses through Bass music, beats, hip hop and trap influences, R&B, deep house, garage, 2 step and downtempo to create a diverse collection of six new songs.",

Though many of the songs featured in this collection have appeared on Gladkill’s 'SESSIONS' mix tape series as well as his live sets throughout the last year, every one of them has been remixed, reworked and remastered to fully realize every composition’s potential. This release provides a form of catharsis and marks the beginning of an exciting new step in Gladkill’s musical journey, paving the way for a full-length album of brand new material in 2015.",
